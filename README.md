## Setup

### What solaris_providers affects

The naming providers included in this module make changes to the SMF properties of the following services:

svc:/network/dns/client  
svc:/network/ldap/client  
svc:/network/nis/client  
svc:/network/nis/domain  

The package providers modify the configuration of IPS.

### Beginning with solaris_providers

For Solaris 11.x puppet module install oracle-solaris_providers  
For Solaris 12.x pkg install puppet/oracle-solaris_providers  

## Usage

Use the puppet describe command to see the properties for each of the defined
providers: dns, ldap, nis, pkg_facet, pkg_mediator, pkg_publisher, pkg_variant

## Reference

The naming providers interact with SMF properties of the following
services using the svcprop(1) command:

svc:/network/dns/client  
svc:/network/ldap/client  
svc:/network/nis/client  
svc:/network/nis/domain  

The package providers interact with IPS using the pkg(1) command.

## Limitations

These modules were created for use on Oracle Solaris 11 and 12.
